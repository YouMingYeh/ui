# shadcn/ui monorepo template

This template is for creating a monorepo with shadcn/ui.

## Usage

```bash
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest init
```

## Adding components

To add components to your app, run the following command at the root of your `web` app:

```bash
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add button -c apps/web
```

This will place the ui components in the `packages/ui/src/components` directory.

## Tailwind

Your `tailwind.config.ts` and `globals.css` are already set up to use the components from the `ui` package.

## Using components

To use the components in your app, import them from the `ui` package.

```tsx
import { Button } from "@workspace/ui/components/ui/button"
```

## Using Docker

If you want to use Docker for development, you can uncomment the following line in the `next.config.mjs` file:

```mjs
output: "standalone", // Uncomment this line if you use Docker
```

And then run the following command:

```bash
docker compose up --build -d
```
